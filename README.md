# CoAPAnalysis
Dataset + Machine Learning code for Anomaly detection on a 5G private network 


## Dataset
The dataset is divided in 2 versions 
- A version with only clear traffic.
- A version with attack logs.
- The dataset will be provided pre-fused, however the Jupyter notebook will provide the steps to fuse the data between multiple clients. 


#### Data  Expunge
- Due to the sensitive nature of syslogs, some sensitive logs have been expunged (eg : Private SSH keys, RSA keys).
- That expunging does not impact the detection.
